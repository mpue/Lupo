/** A circular, lock-free buffer for multiple channels of audio.
 
    Supports a single writer (producer) and any number of readers (consumers).
 
    Make sure that the number of samples read from the RingBuffer in every
    readSamples() call is less than the bufferSize specified in the constructor.
 
    Also, ensure that the number of samples read from the RingBuffer at any time
    plus the number of samples written to the RingBuffer at any time never exceed
    the buffer size. This prevents read/write overlap.

            Although it would seem that the above two lines could cause a
            problem for the consumer calling readsSamples() since it uses the
            value of writePosition to calculate the readPosition, this is not
            the case.
            
            1.  Since writePosition is Atomic, there will be no torn reads.
         
            2.  In the case that the producer only executes the line:
        
                    writePosition += numSamples;
         
                then writePosition has the posibility of being outside the
                bounds of the buffer. If the consumer then calls readsSamples()
                and executes the line:
         
                    int readPosition = (writePosition.get() % bufferSize) - readSize;
         
                it protects itself from an out-of-bounds writePosition by
                calculating the modulus with the buffer size. If the
                writePosition is outside the bounds of the buffer momentarily,
                the consumer's call to readSamples() stays protected and accurate.
